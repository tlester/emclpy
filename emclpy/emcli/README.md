# EMCLI

emcli is the command line interface for Oracle's Enterprise Manager (OEM).  It
is licensed as part of OEM.  Therefore, I have not included it in this module,
but is required for this module to function.  If you are a licensed user of
OEM, you can download your EMCLI kid and put it into this folder.

You can download OEM from Oracle's website at:
